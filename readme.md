# Weather app

This app retieves the weather of a given location. It uses [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and [Darksky](https://darksky.net) APIs and is build in Node.js@12.10.0 and Express@4.17.1.

##Â Local installation

Fill the `/config/env.example` file and rename it to `env.local`. You will need to generate your API keys in [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and [Darksky](https://darksky.net) websites.

Run in your terminal

```
$ npm install
$ npm run-script debug
```

So your app will be running on `localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to Heroku using the next command in your terminal:

```
$ npm run-script deploy:prod
```

For this you will need a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) account and fill in their dashboard the env variables. But the deployment is agnostic and can be configured for any hosting provider.
